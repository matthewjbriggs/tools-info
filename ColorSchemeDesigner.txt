Color Scheme Designer - Matthew Mosher

Color Scheme Designer is a webapp that let's you create a color scheme for whatever project you are working on.  

It lets you select a scheme, like monochromatic, complimentary, analogic, tetrad, etc.

You can then select a base color and brightness and it generates the other asotiated colors as well as a few tints and shades.

It also gives you the hex codes for the colors so you can easily put them into css, html, photoshop, whatever.
